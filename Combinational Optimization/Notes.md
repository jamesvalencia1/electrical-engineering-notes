# Optimal Trees and Paths

## Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)

### Connector Problem

### Minimum Spanning Tree Problem

### Kruskal's Algorithm for MST
Kruskal's Algorithm takes the whole graph into account and chooses to start with the first edge that has the smallest value, then choose the next connections based on the next lowest node with the end node that has not been selected yet.

### Prim's Algorithm for MST
